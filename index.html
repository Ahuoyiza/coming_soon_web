            <h2>DevsHelpDevs, a platform for developers helping developers</h2>
            <p class="note">If you want to join our Slack to contribute or just to learn, send an email to :
                <a href="mailto:@devshelpdevs.org">devshelpdevs.org</a>
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>

            <p>Most developers in industrial countries take it for granted to have state of the art development
                computers,
                always fast
                internet and reliable electricity.
                I too, never spend any thought in this until I got a lot of Twitter followers from Africa and other
                developing
                countries.
                I learned that there is a passionate developer community who doesn't have our infrastructure but
                nevertheless wants for
                be successful in IT.
                Which means a lot of them code on their smartphones because they can't afford a laptop, or often Laptops
                that are in
                catastrophe conditions with too little memory and old CPUs making working slow and often impossible if
                new
                developer
                tools don't run on 32bit systems or need at least 8GB of RAM. Others work with keyboards that miss
                important
                working
                keys so that they have to copy and paste them or enter them cumbersome with the mouse. Others work with
                a
                faulty monitor
                which makes reading difficult or with old batteries in their laptop limiting their work time to the
                parts of
                the day
                where electricity is available.</p>

            <p>When I got to know these people better, I knew we have to help them. With WE, I address all the software
                developers who
                can afford to help especially the ones in the industrial countries. Most of us have the privilege not
                only
                to be able to
                work with an excellent infrastructure but also getting paid very well for that.
                My first idea collecting used Laptops and ship them, turned out to be much more difficult and expensive
                at
                least from
                Germany. While I'm still looking for better ways to ship devices from here, I started to help developers
                who
                needed some
                upgrades or repairs for their computers by sending them money and as I can't afford to do this all the
                time
                I started to
                ask my Twitter followers to jump in and donate parts of what was needed.
                It turned out, that once the abstract need for poor developers in far countries got faces and stories it
                never took long
                to find some donors. As it's not sustainable to ask only my followers multiple times a week for money
                which
                only could
                help a very limited number of people and probably annoy my followers after a while, I think we need a
                real
                platform that
                brings together developers in need with the once willing to help.</p>

            <h2>Goal</h2>

            <p>The goal of this project is to develop a website where developers needing support for their equipment can
                create a
                profile which describes what they need so that people willing to help, can get in touch with them.</p>

            <p>It's definitely not the goal to create any organization that needs funds and employees doing logistics.
                So,
                we need to
                find other ways that allow donors a save and easy way to help. This could be:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Sending money for an upgrade or replacement part which is typically below $100</li>
                <li>Shipping a used Laptop if there is an easy way like from the US to Nigeria</li>
                <li>Pay for a used Laptop which is below $300</li>
                <li>Collect money to buy new laptops</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thinking of that giving one person a working PC can change the whole live for many of these developers in
                need, for an
                amount that for most of us is no problem to afford makes me optimistic that this project can help a lot
                of
                people.
                Ideally this wonâ€™t end with an one-time donation but will lead to friends and mentorships across the
                oceans.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>

            <p>All of the above can be realized with an Web App today. To do this successfully we need to find solutions
                for
                the
                following challenges:</p>


            <h3>Prevent fraud and scams</h3>

            <p>Such a platform can only be successful if people trust it. So we have to come up with ideas how we can
                prevent any scam
                as much as possible. This is absolutely crucial! Some of the receiving countries are unfortunately know
                for
                scammers,
                that's why we need well known IT people supporting and vouching for this project.</p>

            <h3> Making it really easy to help.</h3>
            <p>People with money might be sympathetic to our cause but often are short in time. So we have to make it as
                easy as
                possible for them to select a receiver and send the money to the right place.</p>

            <h2>We need the support of the community</h2>

            <p>None of the above will be possible without the help of many people from the community for:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> Developing this platform as Open Source in the open so that this also can be a place to learn.</li>
                <li>Screening applicants for donations</li>
                <li> Help in case there are problems between donors and receivers.</li>
                <li>Finding trustworthy dealers for (used)Laptops and parts in the different countries.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And in my humble opinion, this system should be built by people from the countries it's aimed to help.
            </p>

            <h2>How will we proceed?</h2>

            <p>Unfortunately, I have no experience in web development at all, so I can't add much help in coding.
                However,
                I can act as
                project manager ensuring that we will reach our goal.
                To get everyone you want to participate started I have active discussions on <a
                    href="https://github.com/DevsHelpDevs/DevsHelpDevs" target="_blank">this repository</a> and
                already
                started
                some threads with questions that we need to answer before we can start doing anything.
                We will start with a minimal feature set to get it launched fast and then add more features as we go.
            </p>
